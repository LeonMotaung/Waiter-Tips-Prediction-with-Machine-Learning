## 🚀 Project Overview

This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts the tip amount a waiter might receive based on various features such as bill amount, party size, time, day of week, and other relevant factors. The model is built using Python and targets to help restaurant management or waitstaff estimate expected tips.

Potential use cases:
- Provide waiters with tip predictions in real-time (e.g. via a small web or mobile UI).
- Analyze tipping behavior to optimize shift allocation.
- Offer insights for restaurant managers on factors influencing tipping (e.g. party size, time of day, weekday vs weekend, etc.)
